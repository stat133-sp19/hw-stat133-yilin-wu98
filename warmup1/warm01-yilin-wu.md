    -   <span style=" font-size:1.5em;"> A famous quote by her</span>

    > "To those who act as agents of chaos, I say this: I stand resolute and unyielding. And if you strike my voice down, know that a chorus of thousands shall rise up in its place, for you have no dominion over the righteous. We are the defenders of truth.

**Cooking Recipe**
==================

Ingredients:

-   1 cup plus 2 tablespoons (9 ounces or 255 grams) salted butter, cold, cut into small pieces

-   1/2 cup (100 grams) granulated sugar

-   1/4 cup (50 grams) light brown sugar
-   1 teaspoon (5 ml) vanilla extract
-   2 1/4 cups (295 grams) all-purpose flour
-   6 ounces (170 grams) semi- or bittersweet dark chocolate, chopped (you want chunks, not thin shards of chocolate)
-   1 large egg
-   Demerara, turbinado, raw, or sanding sugar, for rolling
-   Flaky sea salt for sprinkling

Kitchen tools:

-   bowls
-   refrigerators
-   electric mixer
-   parchment paper or waxed paper
-   oven

Steps:

1.  Beat the butter, granulated and brown sugars, and vanilla with an electric mixer until light and fluffy, scraping down bowl as needed. Add flour, and mix just until combined. Add chocolate chunks, mix just until incorporated. Mixture will look crumbly. Divide between two sheets of parchment paper, waxed paper, or plastic wrap and use your hands to form the dough halves into log shapes about 2 to 2 1/4 inches in diameter. Chill until totally firm, about 2 hours. I hastened this along in the freezer (30 minutes, tops) but did feel that the cookies were better after resting longer. (But do know that it works!)

2.  When you’re ready to bake the cookies, heat your oven to 350°F. Line one or two large baking sheets with parchment paper. Lightly beat the egg and open up your chilled cookies logs to brush it over the sides. Sprinkle the coarse sugar on the open paper or plastic wrap and roll the logs into it, coating them.

3.  Using a sharp serrated knife, cut logs into 1/2-inch thick rounds. You’re going to hit some chocolate chunks, so saw gently, squeezing the cookie to keep it from breaking if needed. Arrange cookie slices on prepared sheets one inch apart (they don’t spread much) and sprinkle each with a few flakes of salt. Bake for 12 to 15 minutes, or until the edges are just beginning to get golden brown. Let cool slightly before transferring to the cookies you don’t eat immediately to wire racks to cool. Do ahead: The dough can made ahead and stored, tightly wrapped in plastic, up to 1 week in the fridge, or 1 month in the freezer. Baked cookies keep in an airtight container for 5 days, or so I’ve heard.

Special Seanson:
There is not any special season and you can cook and eat whenever you want.

Euclien Distance
================

| <span style=" font-size:1.5em;">Definition</span>                                                                                    |
|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| The **Euclidean distance** betwwen points **p** and **q** is the length of the line segment connecting them ($\\mathbf{\\bar{pq}}$). |

In [Cartesian coordinates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cartesian_coordinate_system), if **p** = (*p*<sub>1</sub>, *p*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *p*<sub>*n*</sub>) and **q** = (*q*<sub>1</sub>, *q*<sub>2</sub>, ..., *q*<sub>*n*</sub>) are two points in Euclidean n-space, then the distance(d) from **p** to **q**, or from **q** to **p** is given by the [Pythagorean formula](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pythagorean_theorem).
$$
\\begin{split}
 d(\\mathbf{p,q})=d(\\mathbf{q,p})&=\\sqrt{(q\_1-p\_1)^2+(q\_2-p\_2)^2+...+(q\_n-p\_n)^2}\\\\
&= \\sqrt{\\sum\_{i=1}^{n}(q\_i-p\_i)^2}\\\\
\\end{split}\\tag{1}
$$
 The position of a point in a Euclidean n-space is a [Euclidean vector](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_vector). So, *p* and *q* may be represented as Euclidean vectors, starting from the origin of the space(initial point) with their tips (terminal points) ending at the two points. The [**Euclidean norm**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics)#Euclidean_norm), or **Euclidean length**, or **magnitude** of a vector measures the length of the vector.
$$||\\mathbf{p}||=\\sqrt{p\_1^2+p\_2^2+...+p\_n^2}=\\sqrt{\\mathbf{p \\cdot p}}$$
 where the last expression involves the [dot product](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dot_product).
